## About project
This project was made for Data Visualization Techniques classes. Our task was to get database about food and make a poster with 
interesting data obtained by us. We decided to address inflation in 2018–2022 in Europe. We considered both overall and individual products
price changes in Europe. All codes was written in R programming language.
## Database source
All data bases was downloaded from Eurostat.eu.
